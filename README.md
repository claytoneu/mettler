# mettler - a Settlers of Catan tracking tool

## Getting Started

You'll need NPM installed (or [Node](https://nodejs.org), which is bundled together with NPM). 

Grab the source and in the `/mettler` directory, run `npm install` and that's it!

There's not much to see or do here besides run `npm test` to run some unit tests.
